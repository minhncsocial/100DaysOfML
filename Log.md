## Day 0 : July 31 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : I have setup all the things I needed to complete this challenge and also completed chosing the projects I will work on: "Reinforcement Learning for Robot Grasping".

**Thoughts** : Hope this will be exiciting ,will help me in learning Machine Learning in a more effective way .

## Day 1 : Aug 1 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : I have selected and setup simulation tools: [V-Ref](http://www.coppeliarobotics.com/index.html) . I have to do 2 things: setup simulated environment, research how to control robot in V-Ref. There are 2 tutorial sources: [Nikolai K.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2P7h5Vik9tLafPQ2hlKVLA) and [
vreptutorial dotEH](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbMWe5uU-udNiGVmIHAUmjg). I have to look for which one is suitable for begining.

**Thoughts** : Hope this will be exiciting .

## Day 2 : Aug 2 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : I decide to research paper: [PointNet: Deep Learning on Point Sets for 3D Classification and Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00593)

**Thoughts** : Hope this will be exiciting .

## Day 2 : Aug 2 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : I decide to find the code of [PointNet: Deep Learning on Point Sets for 3D Classification and Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00593) and underderstand it's input, output, the way it runs.

**Thoughts** : I hope I can find out, and I can learn fast from it .
